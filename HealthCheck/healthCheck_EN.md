# First slide

## Squad Health Check model
version 1, September 2014

### What is this?
* A workshop & visualization technique for helping squads* improve

### Who is it for?
* The squad itself
* People supporting the squad (managers, coaches, etc)

### How to use the model
* Print the cards & laminate
  * Slide 2-5 = Awesome Cards (double sided)
  * Slide 6-9 = Voting cards (double sided)
* Get the squad together in a room
* Discuss the Awesome Cards. Each one is a health indicator with an “example of awesome”, and an “example of crappy”. 
* Ask the squad how they feel about each health indicator, using techniques such as voting cards.
  * Green doesn’t mean Perfect. It just means the squad is happy with this, and see no major need for improvement right now.
  * Yellow means there are some important problems that need addressing, but it’s not a disaster.
  * Red means this really sucks and needs to be improved.
* Also discuss the trends (are things improving, stable, or getting worse?)
* Visualize the result, for example like this:
* Use the data to help the squad(s) improve

### Tips
* These cards are just a starting point. Squad is free to add/remove/tweak the questions to match what they think matters.
* Make sure this is used to support the squads, not judge them!

Squad is Spotify’s term for a small, cross-functional, self-organizing development team
