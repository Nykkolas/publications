# First slide

## Squad Health Check model
version 1, September 2014

### What is this?
* A workshop & visualization technique for helping squads* improve

### Who is it for?
* The squad itself
* People supporting the squad (managers, coaches, etc)

### How to use the model
* Print the cards & laminate
  * Slide 2-5 = Awesome Cards (double sided)
  * Slide 6-9 = Voting cards (double sided)
* Get the squad together in a room
* Discuss the Awesome Cards. Each one is a health indicator with an “example of awesome”, and an “example of crappy”. 
* Ask the squad how they feel about each health indicator, using techniques such as voting cards.
  * Green doesn’t mean Perfect. It just means the squad is happy with this, and see no major need for improvement right now.
  * Yellow means there are some important problems that need addressing, but it’s not a disaster.
  * Red means this really sucks and needs to be improved.
* Also discuss the trends (are things improving, stable, or getting worse?)
* Visualize the result, for example like this:
* Use the data to help the squad(s) improve

### Tips
* These cards are just a starting point. Squad is free to add/remove/tweak the questions to match what they think matters.
* Make sure this is used to support the squads, not judge them!

Squad is Spotify’s term for a small, cross-functional, self-organizing development team

# Second slide

## Delivering Value
* We deliver great stuff! We're proud of it and our stakeholders are really happy.
* We deliver crap. We feel ashamed to deliver it. Our stakeholders hate us.

## Easy to release
* Releasing is simple, safe, painless and mostly automated.
* Releasing is risky, painful, lots of manual work and takes forever.

## Fun
* We love going to work and have great fun working together!
* Boooooooring...

## Health of Codebase
* We're proud of the quality of our code! It is clean, easy to read and has great test coverage.
* Our code is a pile of dung and technical debt is raging out of control.

## Learning
* We're learning lots of interesting stuff all the time!
* We never have time to learn anything.

## Mission
* We know exactly why we are here and we’re really excited about it!
* We have no idea why we are here, there's no high lever picture or focus. Our so called mission is completely unclear and uninspiring.

## Pawns or Players
* We are in control of our own destiny! We decide what to build and how to build it.
* We are just pawns in a game of chess with no influence over what we build or how we build it.

## Speed
* We get stuff done really quickly! No waiting and no delays.
* We never seem to get anything done. We keep getting stuck or interrupted. Stories keep getting stuck on dependencies.
